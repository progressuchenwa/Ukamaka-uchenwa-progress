#𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗼, 𝗜’𝗺 𝗨𝗸𝗮𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗮 𝗨𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗻𝘄𝗮 (𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀) 👋 
I’m a *Data Analyst* with a background in executive virtual assistance, where I spent over five years helping business leaders manage operations, organize information, and make decisions. That experience shaped the way I approach data today: I care deeply about clarity, problem-solving, and making work easier for others.  
##𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜 𝗗𝗼 🔎
I enjoy taking messy data and turning it into something clean, structured, and meaningful.  
Whether it’s:  
- Building *dashboards*  
- Designing *pivot-table reports*  
- Creating *calculated metrics*  

I love showing the story behind the numbers.  
My projects so far include dashboards for:  
- Restaurant operations 🍴  
-  Sales performance  💰
- Financial expenses  📉
  
All focused on helping businesses see what’s working and what isn’t.  

## How I Work 🛠
I approach work with *detail, curiosity, and intention*.  
Colleagues often describe me as someone who values:  
- Clear communication   
- Organization   
- Professionalism  
I believe in being intentional with my work and delivering insights that actually help decision-makers take action.  

## Beyond Data 🌟  
Outside of analytics, I enjoy;  
- Dancing & Music  
- Cooking (experimenting with recipes and creating new flavors)  
- Strategy games & Research  
Most of all, I love *learning new skills and growing* that’s what took me from executive assistance into analytics, and what drives me forward today.

This portfolio is where I share my journey in data, combining my *business background, curiosity, and growing technical skills*.
